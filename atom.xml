    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Getting a speaking engagement</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been attending talks presented by the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/js-chi/">js.chi() meetup group</a> for several years now. I&rsquo;ve always respected those that presented, regardless of how well assembled their presentations were. And after having personally benefitted from a number of talks (not to mention free food and beer!) I felt it was time to give back.</p>

<p>After learning many of the ins and outs of CoffeeScript, Backbone, <a href="http://brunch.io/">Brunch</a> and <a href="http://chaplinjs.org/">Chaplin</a> I felt I had something unique to offer a crowd of listeners. And so I reached out to <a href="https://twitter.com/wondible">Justin Love</a> and threw my name in for a possible speaking engagement. And after some time, Justin reached out and asked if I was still up for giving a talk. The answer was yes, and so a talk was scheduled.</p>

<h2>Prep work leading up to the talk</h2>

<p>One thing I look for in talks I listen to are takeaways. And so leading up to <a href="http://www.meetup.com/js-chi/events/132710002/">the talk</a> I spend a good deal of time putting together examples to help showcase some of the technologies and tools I&rsquo;d be discussing which people could take home and study and play around with themselves. The goal was not to leave the audience with not just a <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jhabdas/hopstop">sleek-looking slide deck</a> but also examples tied together with a <a href="https://github.com/jhabdas/hopstop">full-blown example application</a>. So during the days and weeks leading up to the talk (which I hope to give again at other venues), I added a number of upgrades and new features to the app, which also helped solidify my understanding of what I&rsquo;d be speaking about.</p>

<h2>Delivering to the crowd</h2>

<p>While I&rsquo;ve spoken to crows before, by no means am I a seasoned speaker. There were some butterflies. But rather than letting anxiety work against me, I turned it into positive energy and used it to do the best job I could. And in the minutes leading up to the talk I simply focused on how the information I delivered could change the way the audience worked, ideally to improve developer productivity and happiness. (Note: The beer I had just prior to the speech didn&rsquo;t hurt either.)</p>

<h2>The after effects</h2>

<p>Before giving the talk, I&rsquo;d expected that, after it was over, I&rsquo;d be content and move on. But what really happened surprised me. After the talk was over I simply wished I could do it for a larger crowd. Instead of 100 people, why not shoot for 250 or more? Perhaps even a conference at some point. And so my hope is to continue delivering talks in the future to front-end developers and hobbyists alike who love the craft and are eager to learn. And if you&rsquo;re thinking about speaking but are not comfortable with the idea but think you might like it, just try it and find out. It&rsquo;s good to push yourself to the edge and beyond. You never know, someday it could be you behind the podium giving the keynote.</p>

    <link href="http://techblog.trunkclub.com/moving-from-tumblr-to-octopress/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://techblog.trunkclub.com/moving-from-tumblr-to-octopress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At Trunk Club, we love technology. It&rsquo;s at the core of our business and helps enable us to provide amazing user experiences both internally and externally. So, when asked recently to help provide opinion on our tech blog, I was excited for opportunity&mdash;until I saw the blog was hosted on Tumblr.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with Tumblr? Nothing, really, except that, as an engineer who&rsquo;s been maintaining a technical blog for the last 5 years, I found it difficult to voice an opinion on a platform I myself didn&rsquo;t fully embrace&mdash;to me it was just another CMS, and a bit restrictive at that. So before writing this post, I felt compelled to move our tech blog away from Tumblr. Read on to learn about the Octopress migration, and how to set up a wicked quick, CMS-free blog with free hosting and then some.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>CMS blogs don&rsquo;t feel quite as fast</h2>

<p>Based on personal experiences with CMS-driven blogs like <a href="http://www.habdas.org/drupal-7-for-wordpress-admins/">WordPress and Drupal</a>, going CMS-free was the first requirement. This was primarily a performance play, as CMS-driven sites, even Wordpress with W3 Total Cache, CloudFront and any number of performance tweaks simply can&rsquo;t compete with a static site witout a jauggernaut of an app server behind it. There was no second requirement. (Assume the obvious.)</p>

<p>At Trunk Club we write a lot of Ruby and CoffeeScript. So it seemed fitting we should chose a blog which leverages one of those technologies. After looking briefly at Jekyll, I noticed Octopress. And after looking at Octopress, I noticed it could be hosted on GitHub pages&mdash;for free&mdash;and be build by Travis-CI (also for free). That&rsquo;s a  lot of free, so let&rsquo;s briefly recap what we&rsquo;re building:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open source site to help illustrate how Trunk Club uses <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a></li>
<li>Blog is of the CMS-free variety and based on the wonderful <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby language</a></li>
<li>Hosting righ tnow is free thanks to <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a></li>
<li>Continuous Integration using <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis-CI</a></li>
<li>Support for <a href="http://prose.io/">Prose.io</a>, to simplify post authoring and enable blogging from a desktop or mobile web browser</li>
<li>Integration with the 37signals&#8217; Campfire to post build notifications</li>
</ul>


<h2>Found just what I was looking for</h2>

<p>After some searching I was able to unearth enough material to lead me to reverse engineer what was being done, resulting in a <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/go/publish/4845414">system diagram</a> I could use to illustrate how the whole thing worked. Feedback on the whole concept was positive, so I started building. After a bit of trial and error given different approaches, I ended up finding the following excellent article, which boils most of the setup process into a small number of easily reproducable steps:</p>

<p><a href="http://rogerz.github.io/blog/2013/02/21/prose-io-github-travis-ci/">Octopress+Prose+Github+Travis CI = Coders&#8217; Blog</a></p>

<h2>Adjustments to the above to make it all work</h2>

<p>The above instructions were less than a year old, but alone would not work for me. Please note the additional steps needed for me to get <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/go/publish/4845414">the whole thing</a> working properly.</p>

<h3>Enabling online post authoring, web and mobile web</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/prose/prose/wiki/Prose-Configuration">Prose configuration</a> had to be modified for allow for post authoring. Here&rsquo;s at an early Trunk Club configuration:</p>

<h3>Who&rsquo;s that Travis fellow anyway</h3>

<p>After modifying the <code>Rakefile</code> and <code>.travis.yml</code>, and getting the <a href="https://travis-ci.org/trunkclub/trunkclub.github.io">Travis integration</a> ready, Travis was reporting successful builds although the <code>rake deploy</code> task was failing. I did some digging and was able to turn up a <a href="https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-cookbooks/issues/159#issuecomment-21675873">nice fix</a>, copied here for convenience:</p>

<pre><code>before_install:
  - git config --global user.name "Travis CI"
  - git config --global user.email "user@example.com"
</code></pre>

<h3>Twitter loading, loading, bueller</h3>

<p>With a <code>twitter_user</code> set using the Octopress Unless patched, users with a vanilla Octopress install will notice <em>tweets won&rsquo;t load</em>, the result of an API <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog/api-housekeeping">Twitter chose to sunset</a>. Fixing this is as simple as creating a new aside, like the following file added to <code>_includes/custom/asides</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>twitter_widget.html</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When updating asides, don&rsquo;t forget to adjust the asides configuration in <code>source/_config.yml</code>.</p>

<h3>Lazy-loading YouTube videos</h3>

<p>If migrating from a blog with video content hosted on YouTube, check out the <a href="https://github.com/erossignon/jekyll-youtube-lazyloading/"><code>jekyll-youtube-lazyloading</code></a> plug-in, which adds a preview screenshot image to a page and waits for a click event before appending the video <code>iframe</code> to the DOM, resulting in a snappier UI and faster download for pages with YouTube-hosted video content.</p>

<p>Once the plug-in is installed, YouTube videos can be embedded using the <code>youtube</code> liquid tag, así:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>twitter_widget.html</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>So long, Tumblbeasts</h2>

<p>Wrapping things up, I used the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-import">Jekyll import tool</a> to pull the posts from our old tech blog on Tumblr and create simple <code>meta</code> redirects for referrers linking to the rather non-semantic Tumblr URLs, helping prevent linkrot and moving the TC tech blog to a better canonicalized URL structure (and somewhere an SEO guy cheers). Once that was done I modified the Octopress config YAML and post frontmatter, finished up with various copy editing and post migration tasks, including adding the <code>CNAME</code> file and updating the DNS to point to the new home of the Trunk Club Tech Blog. And poof. The new blog came alive.</p>

<p>Let the blogging begin.</p>

    <id>http://techblog.trunkclub.com/programming-on-the-command-line</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>The command line is your friend</h2>

<p>Recently it dawned on me that one of the most useful things I’ve learned since college was actually one of the older technologies when it comes to computers: the unix command line and how to “program” using it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>How is CLI programming</h2>

<p>What I’ve always heard referred to as “Taco Bell ® Programming” is the art of combining several commands to acheive something much more powerful. This is nothing crazy, we’ve probably all tailed a filed and piped (|) it to grep before, that makes you a taco bell ® programmer. For those of you who have never done that, let me explain. tailing a file, simply means that your display is constantly being updated with the contents of the file. This is very useful when you want to see the contents of a log file. But many times when you’re looking for something in a log file, you don’t want or need to see every line of that file, you’ve logged much more than you need to troubleshoot this issue. This is where grep comes in, it allows you to only show the lines of a body of text that contain a phrase you’re looking for. Here’s an example where I’m following my production log file and looking for the lines that contain “Publishing Message”:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>tail -f production.log | grep <span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span>Publishing message<span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That’s just the begining of how the command line can be useful. Let’s say that this message returns us a lot of lines that looks like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">Publishing</span> <span class="ss">message</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">exchange</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">member_example_event</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">opts</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:headers</span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;message_id&quot;</span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="s2">&quot;message2&quot;</span><span class="p">}},</span> <span class="ss">message</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;{</span><span class="se">\&quot;</span><span class="s2">id</span><span class="se">\&quot;</span><span class="s2">:123456,</span><span class="se">\&quot;</span><span class="s2">first_name</span><span class="se">\&quot;</span><span class="s2">:</span><span class="se">\&quot;</span><span class="s2">Example</span><span class="se">\&quot;</span><span class="s2">,</span><span class="se">\&quot;</span><span class="s2">last_name</span><span class="se">\&quot;</span><span class="s2">:</span><span class="se">\&quot;</span><span class="s2">Member</span><span class="se">\&quot;</span><span class="s2">,</span><span class="se">\&quot;</span><span class="s2">email</span><span class="se">\&quot;</span><span class="s2">:</span><span class="se">\&quot;</span><span class="s2">example.member@example.com</span><span class="se">\&quot;</span><span class="s2">}&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And from these lines we want a list of all the member’s email addresses. How do we do this? Yes, I’m sure most of you are thinking, “Why not write a ruby script?” (where ruby could be any language). Some of you might even be thinking “I can do that in VIM”. (That one would be me). But why not just use the command line? A tool that is already at your disposal? Probably because, you’re not familiar with how to. Let’s do this piece by piece:</p>

<p>First we need to remove the parts of the message we don’t need. To do this, I would use the cut command, which acts much like split in ruby. I’m going to cut on the ‘,’ (-d,) and then take only the parts of the cut line that I want by passing -f6.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>tail -f production.log | grep <span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span>Publishing message<span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span> | cut -d, -f6
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c">#\&quot;email\&quot;:\&quot;example.member@example.com\&quot;}&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, I think I would cut that again on ‘”’ to get to my email address, but this leaves a trailing ‘&#8217;, so I’ll use sed, which is like sub in ruby to remove it:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>tail -f production.log | grep <span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span>Publishing message<span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span> | cut -d, -f6 | cut -d<span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span><span class="err">&quot;</span><span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span> -f4 | sed <span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span>s/<span class="se">\\</span>//<span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c">#example.member@example.com</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And we’re done! Now we can tail the logs and see on our screen the email addresses for members who have had a message published about them in our system. How would you have accomplished this? Similarly or completely different?</p>

<p>This example may be a bit contrived, however being able to string together a series of unix commands can be very useful, especially if you’re sshed into a server and might not have the ability to create a file, or maybe that server does not have ruby installed.</p>

<p>Why is it called Taco Bell ® Programming?</p>

<p>I cannot take this credit for this and I cannot remember where I first heard this term, but searching the internet shows that it seems to come from <a href="http://teddziuba.com/">Ted Dziuba</a>, but his blog post on it is no longer available. What it comes down to is that most of the food Taco Bell’s ® is made of by combining many of the same ingredients differently. When we’re writing this helper scripts on the command line we’re just combining all of these programs that already exist produce a program that fits our need, each time.</p>

<p>Learning how to use these commands</p>

<p>Personally I find my self just reading man (manual) pages on these apps or googling some examples for them. Another useful linux tool is apropos which can be used to search all available commands and their descriptions.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>build standing pairing stations.</p>

<p>Who am I?</p>

<p>Let me start this post by introducing myself. I’ve been a Software Engineer at <a href="http://trunkclub.com/">Trunk Club</a> for a little over six months and previous to that I was a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="http://drw.com/">DRW Trading</a>. In addition to these full-time jobs I’ve also been involved in a few side projects.</p>

<p>I attended the University of Michigan where I received my degree in computer science. After I graduated there in the winter of 2007 I moved to Chicago to do what any other recent college graduate does, start my career, which is when I started at DRW.</p>

<p>Since then I’ve had the opportunity to learn a variety of different things from a variety of people. These lessons range anywhere from dark text-editor themes being easier on the eyes to using message queuing systems to create a distributed app eco-system. Another such lesson is the benefits of being able to stand while working.</p>

<p>Getting things done</p>

<p>I’m not going to talk too deeply about the pros and cons of standing and sitting while at work. You can find various articles and blog posts about them (I’ve listed a few at the end). In short, you burn more calories, your back and lower body will hurt less (after getting used to standing more), and even increases in your productivity. And personally, I will tell you that I had the opportunity to experience standing all day, and it’s something that everyone should try.</p>

<p>If you ask any of my current colleagues at Trunk Club they’ll tell you that when I think something is benefinical, I don’t keep my mouth shut. In the past six months due to some of my vocal persistence, the tech team has transitioned towards more consistent pairing throughout the day. As soon as pairing became the daily norm, I turned some of my attention towards being able to stand while we pair. After several converstaions with Mike Wolf, one day we decided that we had to find a way to “test it out”, since purchasing a true standing desk was expensive for something no one else on the team had tried.</p>

<p>Just some racks</p>

<p>MVP then refactor</p>

<p>As is the case with both writing code and a startup, rarely does one end up building the final solution on their first attempt. For developers, we are constantly writing the minimum to get a broken test to pass and then refactoring to a more elegant solution over time. Trunk Club has taken a similar approach to our technology as well. Three years ago our website was nothing more than a WordPress Blog, now we have several different applications supporting our company. And we are constantly making that even better.</p>

<p>But wait, I thought we were talking about standing desks? Yes! We are! Our first foray into the world of standing at work didn’t require an $800 desks that can be moved up and down. (Actually it’s more like $1600 since we pair.)</p>

<p>We took a page out of MacGyver’s play book and built something from what we had all around our office. What was that? baker’s racks, or as we use them, clothing racks. The metal racks with adjustable shelving allowed Mike Wolf and I were able to create Trunk Club’s first standing pairing station.</p>

<p>The standing pairing station is in such high demand, that we’ve constructed a second. After the second version, we’ve begun discussing possible refactorings to our solution, which include buying a version of the aforementioned desks top solutions.</p>

<p>Do you or your team stand on a regular basis? What solution do you use? Want to come see our bakers rack? Drop by TCHQ and check it out while we have beer. Let me know <a href="https://twitter.com/joelash">@joelash</a></p>

    <id>http://techblog.trunkclub.com/my-trunk-club-101-week</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The tech team came up with a list of tasks that every member of the team should complete in order to better understand the business. Building tools for other functions of the company helps us to understand what those departments do and how we can help them.</p>

<p>I attempted to go through this task list in one week and blog about the experience.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><strong>Operations</strong></p>

<p>I got to fulfill a trunk, pack a trunk and unpack a trunk return. It took me less than an hour to go through it, and it showed me some of the pain points that our ops team is going through, especially as we scale so rapidly.</p>

<p><strong>Sales</strong></p>

<p>One of the most fun tasks was to participate in a training session: Once a week, the sales team picks three items, and creates a scenario for each outfit. These are usually items that sell well but are not often enough put in trunks. For each item we get a member profile: an imaginary member with a specific age, budget, location, profession. My item was a green sweater, and “my guy” lived in Miami and really wanted that green sweater, which I paired with white pants and an orange belt. I got the second most votes for my outfit and actually learned a lot. I need to attend these sessions more often (and win!).
I also got to participate in a cold call, get a repeat styling, and build a trunk for a customer. (Update: the trunk came back and was a success!! The customer kept several items and the sale was double the average trunk value).</p>

<p><strong>Finance</strong></p>

<p>I went through the process of billing a trunk… I’ve worked a lot with the finance team since I started here, and we’ve made huge progress using technology to simplify tasks. Going through this exercise highlighted even more features we can build for them. 
Customer Service:
I answered customer calls, checked out in-person fittings in POS and tracked down delinquent trunks. These guys do an amazing job considering the inefficiencies of some of the tools that they have at their disposal. We can definitely help here.</p>

<p><strong>Merchandising</strong></p>

<p>I participated in a product training meeting, (mock-)ordered a product, and realized how painful it was to enter a new product into Quickbooks.
Technology:
I gave a Lunch and Learn entitled “How we’ve been doing our releases (January 2013)” and finally wrote a blog post to round up the task list (you’re reading it).
This has been very rewarding and enlightening. I’ve already fixed a few issues brought up during my training. Because the business is growing and evolving so fast, I definitely want to go through this list again in a few months. Can’t wait to see how much better we’re doing!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So … it’s been eight weeks since my last blog post. The last blog post I wrote said: “Next week: Review, working in a smaller team, Kissmetrics and Trunkboards version 2.” The review went very well, the second part of my apprenticeship was eye-opening and I definitely felt like I turned a corner. Concepts and patterns were easier to understand, I felt more useful when pairing, and I was able to get more done.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Teams have been broken down into smaller team focused on specific functions within the company, and I completed the Kissmetrics and Trunkboards v2 projects.</p>

<p>To be honest, the last eight weeks are a big blur. It’s been very intense, a race to the finish to accomplish as much as I could during this apprenticeship. I wish I had blogged more but it was not a priority: If I were to graduate from my apprenticeship and become an engineer, I would no longer have the luxury of being an apprentice, i.e. spending so much time learning. So I made the most of the time I had left.</p>

<p>I had my final review at the end of last month. Everyone from the tech team was there, plus a few people from the product team. I did two presentations: one just for the tech team, highlighting everything that I learned, and a second presentation for the larger group talking about the apprenticeship itself, how I got there and what I got out of it, followed by questions and answers.</p>

<p>It was awesome to list the stuff that I had learned, and also see how much more there was for me to learn. I appreciated getting feedback on my performance and hearing what people thought I should focus on next.</p>

<p>I left the room to let the group discuss what was now my application for an engineering position. I would be leaving for a pre-planned trip to Europe just two days later and would be gone for almost three weeks, so I was eager to hear the outcome of the apprenticeship before leaving. The day after the final review, before a happy hour event with the sales team, I got the great news from Mike Cruz that Trunk Club was offering me a position as a Software Engineer. I’m very happy and excited to have accepted that offer today.</p>

    <id>http://techblog.trunkclub.com/trunk-club-apprenticeship-week-18</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now that felt great: I worked on a project that was very similar to last week’s Kissmetrics project, except this time it took me two days to finish it instead of five! I’m now completing projects regularly and I have code to commit to the release every week. My contribution level is definitely increasing on a weekly basis.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Part of it is understanding our code base better, but part of it is also having a much smoother workflow. I program, test, commit, present/test with stakeholders with much more ease now, which allows me to focus more on my code. Things are easier with the product team. I feel like I’m more helpful and pro-active with them, and we get more done.</p>

<p>I’m also able to quickly build upon what I have just learned, needing less time to digest. Tuesday night, at the end of the day, I received a request for a feature and was able to get it done just a few hours later. A few weeks ago such time constraints would guarantee not finishing on time, but this one was doable thanks to the projects that I worked on the last few weeks. I feel like I can take on a much wider variety of projects now. I probably just need more time to complete them than others (which I don’t mind taking), and even that is slowly getting better. It’s all about adding more value.</p>

<p>I finished reading Seven Languages in Seven Weeks. I’ll post my notes on Seven Languages shortly, but the short take on it is this: Great book, helped me understand how other languages (non-OO, functional etc.) function, and what the best use for some of them is. Sometimes it was a bit above my level, but never enough not be understandable and useful. I’m going to pick one of the languages to play with it (Scala or Haskell?) and I’ll probably read the book again in a few months. This week I went back to a non-coding book and started reading <a href="http://amzn.com/1934356581">Agile Samurai</a> by Jonathan Rasmusson.</p>

<p>This weekend I will be finishing up preparing for my four month review on Monday. The last couple of months have been awesome, with an acceleration of my learning mid-way through, and I’m excited to present it to the team.</p>

<p>Next week: Review, working in a smaller team, Kissmetrics and Trunkboards version 2.</p>

    <id>http://techblog.trunkclub.com/trunk-club-apprenticeship-week-17</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week I started and finished the Kissmetrics project that was assigned to me. Pairing with Mike on Monday helped get me started and after that it was just a matter of going through the stories that were assigned to me one by one. We’re also improving our testing methodology and testing earlier in the week, testing with the product manager both locally as soon as possible and on staging after the weekly code freeze. Of course some things were not working while testing. Sometimes the logic hadn’t been thought through, and sometimes my environment wasn’t set up properly for testing. And throughout the week we were getting feedback from end-users that meant changes in the specifications. But I am happy that even with all these bumps on the road I managed to deliver the finished project on time for the release.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I’m also getting more comfortable with releasing, using apache, figuring out log files and understanding errors. While I may never become a dev-ops, I do want to master that area of expertise so that I can help with it whenever necessary. I’m using heroku for the moment for my side/learning-project but as soon as the mvp is live I want to move it to AWS or Linode and learn how to deploy and maintain applications on a VPS.</p>

<p>Finally, I’m getting ready for my four-month review, coming up soon on July 2nd. I’ll be at the office this weekend working on the presentation itself and the web application that I will be demoing. I’m nervous but also excited because while the last two months have been very busy, I feel like I didn’t get enough apprenticeship tasks done. At the same time, I really turned a corner: things make sense, learning is easier and faster, and I’m so much more productive. I’ll continue working on making a great presentation next week.</p>

<p>Also next week: Implementing Iron workers on Trunkboard, using Redis better for performance, fixing sales report bugs before the end of the month.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started working on the Kissmetrics and Leviathan integration this week. It’s the first time that I have worked with our www application. Browsing the code and finding what I’m looking for takes a little bit of help but it’s definitely much less cryptic than I thought. Familiarity with our business and our code base on the API side is definitely helping.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I also started using Resque for queuing background jobs. That’s another thing that feels really straight-forward now and was difficult to implement a few months ago. We’re sending the data to Kissmetrics asynchronously to reduce the load. This is a good use case for asynchronous jobs and we’ll be looking into more jobs that could use this method and speed up our application.</p>

<p>I finished reading the Sinatra book that I picked up a few weeks ago. I put it down for too long after moving away from the Sinatra app that I was working on but finally finished it. I started reading the next book on my list: <a href="http://amzn.com/193435659X">Seven Languages in Seven Weeks</a> by Bruce Tate. Going through the Ruby chapter was quick, a nice refresher. I’m moving on to IO this weekend.</p>

<p>Next week: finishing the Kissmetrics project, improving Trunkboards and getting ready for my four month review.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week we had our second hack day: different teams, different projects, same goal to build something in a day that could benefit the business. This time we had several themes to pick from, including Salesforce integration, social graph and inventory management. Our team built a notification system for stylists to be notified when an item that is not in stock becomes available. We also built a neat tool to search items in our inventory while building a trunk. The notification feature will soon make its way to production, which would make it the first feature coming out of hack day to make its way to our main application. The other team built an iPad app that lets you vote for your most stylish friend after pulling them from Facebook, a fun game that could help us with lead sourcing. The rest of the company will get to pick the winner next week during our demo time.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I got to play with Redis for caching. I am trying to improve the performance of Trunkboards. All of these queries add up and it took too long for the page to load in my opinion (around 20 seconds). So I started caching the data using Redis for the queries that took the longest to respond, running them if there is no data in Redis and expiring them after an hour. It’s much better, with the page load time down to around 5 seconds. But I think it can be improved more by running the queries through a background job at regular intervals and have Trunkboards only query Redis. For now, I’m waiting to get feedback from users before working on the next features of Trunkboards.</p>

<p>I got a new project: the Kissmetrics integration. As part of our push for data we will start using Kissmetrics to track our sales funnel. This requires me to record a variety of events throughout our applications. I’m very interested in this project because it will force me to understand our front-end application and how it interacts with our API.</p>

<p>Next week: Kissmetrics, Resque/Redis for queuing, finshing a book and starting a new one.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week was a little slower. It had to be after the long and intense previous week. I had put in a lot of hours to get Trunkboards released. It was great to get that done but I needed a slower week. I got to spend a little less time coding and a little more time reading, blogging and learning.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Working on Trunkboards also helped me work with the product team and stakeholders. I have always been on the other side of the equation, giving product specifications and instructions to the product team or the tech team. Now I am getting instructions and specifications for the work to be done. The benefit of working in a smaller company (although not too small) is that I can provide a lot of feedback and opinion on the final outcome. I also get to work closely with the stakeholders who are never sitting very far from me.</p>

<p>One achievement that I failed to mentioned last week was getting Devise installed on Trunkboards in just a few hours. Last year, during Code Academy, I tried to get it on my application and couldn’t understand how to make it work. I ended up building my own authentication system. After Code Academy, while I was looking for a job, I tried again on a new application. It was easier but it still felt not flexible enough. So I felt great when last week I got it to work exactly how I wanted it to while spending less than a few hours on it (most of it having fun with CSS styling of the login page). It’s another step that shows me how far I’ve come and how much I’ve learned in the last few months.</p>

<p>Next week: working on a different code base, learning REDIS and hack day &ndash; the return!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What a great week: I just built an entire Rails app from scratch for Trunk Club. GeckoBoard was not giving us enough flexibility and the charts were too big for the largest widget size allowed. So I more or less built a custom version of GeckoBoards for Trunk Club.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Thanks to the Sinatra app that I built last week it was easy to just get the data by calling the API that we used to push data to GeckoBoards. After the initial setup, I spent a big part of the week on implementing Highcharts (fun) and I spent the other part of the week working on the look and feel of the app with SASS (more fun). And I also implemented a feature to send a daily email in the morning to stakeholder so that they see yesterday’s KPIs on their way to work, a feature to export a dashboard to pdf to share it with others, and authentication through Devise using our employee database. Woo!</p>

<p>I keep feeling like I need less help. I still get stuck but not against a wall, just slowly making progress and eventually getting there. However, the week was pretty long and I haven’t been really good at pacing myself or doing apprenticeship tasks such as reading and bogging. I think it’s ok every now and then but I don’t want to get burned out either.</p>

<p>Next week: resuming blogging, moving on to another project, planning for four months apprenticeship review.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week I built my first Sinatra app! It was refreshing to work with such a simple and lightweight framework. I also got my own Heroku instance to deploy the app, which will allow me to circumvent our usual weekly release cycle in favor of daily code releases while we build up the application.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The main purpose of the app is to run specific queries on our main database to extract KPIs and then output the data in json to be displayed in Geckoboards or another application that would call the service.</p>

<p>In retrospect, I kinda regret that Mike set this Sinatra app up to help me get started. It was simple enough that I should have done it myself. But it makes sense that I still need help.</p>

<p>Since I’m going to work with Sinatra for a little while, I picked up Sinatra: Up and Running by Alan Harris and Konstantin Haase. It’s a short book, with a good section on the basics that can serve as reference. It also features an interesting section that digs deeper into middleware and modular applications. I’ll report on it soon.</p>

<p>Next week: replacing GeckoBoards, finishing deadline.</p>

<p>I finished reading Passionate Programmer this week. I really enjoyed it and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to start a career as a developer. It is full of good advice, examples and reminders. It is very pragmatic. I’ll write a blog post soon highlighting my favorite excerpts. Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/chadfowler">Chad</a>!</p>

<p>I also released the new sales report that I have been working on for the last couple of weeks. With the new features that were added to it, the finance team now has a tool that’s easier for them use to notify the company about the sales performance of every sales person. It’s also a more efficient way for them to do this daily task and will save them a lot of time. I do like that aspect of the job, making other employees’ job easier through the use of technology.</p>

<p>This week I feel like I turned a corner: things are easier and I can tackle larger projects. I’m less often asking “How do you do this?” so much, it’s more often “Is this how you do it?”. It feels good after two months of working pretty hard.</p>

<p>Next week: I’m building my first Sinatra application.</p>

He has spent the last year of his high school on an “Apprenticeship Tour,” working at EdgeCase and 2Checkout.com in Columbus, OH and at LeanDog in Cleveland, OH. He used a lot of chapters from Dave Hoover’s book on <a href="http://amzn.com/0596518382">apprenticeships</a> as discussion topics, elaborating on them based on his own experience. He is definitely a strong advocate of apprenticeships, with an interesting experience.</p>

<p>I had a bit of a setback with my month-to-date sales report project and spent a lot of time this week dealing with that. We had to re-think how it was going to be generated, which meant changing our database a bit and dealing with time zone inconsistencies. As disappointing as that was, it was very interesting to review my code from just a few weeks ago. I had to do a lot of refactoring and I felt like my code was getting cleaner and leaner. It was a long but meaningful exercise.</p>

<p>Next week: working on a new BI tool that was developed internally, finishing reading Passionate Programmer, launching the new sales reports.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week I completed my first major project, a sales report for management. It will evolve over the next few weeks but it’s nice to get version one working. I spent the whole week on it, banging my head against a wall frequently. And then on Friday at 5:30 pm it finally worked. I think there’s no better time for a project to be completed. It feels like a nice, challenging, full week and it ends right on time to enjoy the weekend.</p>

<p>I also needed less help, as things are getting easier. I still need direction and help, getting started but after that things seem to be less difficult than they used to be. And I’m getting more comfortable leaving something unfinished until the next day. I always worried about that but familiarity with the code and the job is all I really needed.</p>

<p>In other news, I was really impressed by <a href="http://www.gooddata.com/">GoodData&rsquo;s</a> product presentation. They built a slick and powerful tool. It may be doing much more than we need, but I would love to work with them at some point. Although a product offering that services all the pain points of BI is good and bad: it&#8217;&rsquo;s nice to only use only one solution but there&#8217;&rsquo;s also much less flexibility. And they&#8217;&rsquo;re pretty expensive. But overall, great product, great demo (the guys on the call were very good), solid solution.</p>

<p>We had our first hack day today. Two teams of engineers and product managers, eight hours. We worked with the Twilio API to facilitate communications between our members and our stylists. I helped were I could, mostly working on the front-end of the app. I haven’t done much CSS since I got here so it was nice to get to play with it again (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/shayhowe">Shay</a> for your <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/">lessons</a> during Code Academy!). I think it’s pretty obvious that we won but the other team is still arguing about it. The whole company will get to see the demo next week and vote for the winner. I’m curious to see how what we built is going to be re-integrated into our main applications.</p>

<p>Next week: We’re going to start working on an interesting challenge: discontinuing use of a third-party tool that was great to help us get started but that we have outgrown and is now causing too much pain. The sales report that I built this week is going to help, but there’s still a lot more to do. It’ll be exciting to work on it and help the business move to a tool better suited for our current growth.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After listening to Corey Ehmke’s presentaion on MongoDB last week I decided to try and implement Mongo for data snapshots. I gotta say I had a lot of fun pairing with Corey and realizing how awesome Mongo is. Now thanks to this exercise we’re saving snapshots of data to look at historicals. Sweet!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I ended up presenting about Mongo at our weekly team lunch. I wanted to share what I learned as well as my excitement. It was mostly a code review with some good feedback from the rest of the tech team. It also reminded me that I need to work a lot more on my presentation skills…</p>

<p>This week Gilt’s co-founder Alexandra Wilson came to talk to us. Her experience starting and growing a business like Gilt was very interesting. A lot of the talk focused on sales and marketing but there were also some interesting questions and remarks about technology. While we’re not direct competitors (we don’t do discounts), we do go after some of the same customers, so it was interesting to hear her story.</p>

<p>Next week will be busy: GoodData demo, finishing a daily report email for finance and our first hack day on Friday!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week I have been pairing a lot more. I think I paired with almost every back-end developer that we have. Naturally it reminded me of the 12 weeks of Code Academy. Overall it was very good and I certainly learned a lot. It also helped that everyone I paired with took the time to answer any questions that I had, no matter how trivial or complex.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It was also nice to see how each one of them actually worked. Some focus a lot on TDD, while others have a “get things done” approach. It was refreshing to see that no matter what their level was, each one of them made mistakes or sometimes needed help as well.</p>

<p>Overall, it reaffirms the decision I made to become a programmer.</p>

<p>Regarding the apprenticeship itself, the wiki list of topics is finalized and I updated my previous post about it to reflect the few changes that were made.</p>

<p>Finally, this week during our weekly Team Lunch, Corey did a presentation on MongoDB that helped me finally understand what NOSQL databases are about.</p>

<p>Previously, I had only worked with MS SQL, mysql and Postgresql and never really knew how to use Mongodb. Now I found a good way to use it next week on my GeckoBoard project for data snapshots. Excited!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week we released the GeckoBoards that I’ve been working on for the last couple of weeks. With these, the company has access to key metrics about the health of the business. Before that, that data was either not available or required finance to dig into the database.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Working within our Rails app I learned to create a service layer that outputs the data in json. I used presenters and learned more SQL. GeckoBoard can then call our app and request the data to display it in nice widgets. However, I can already see us quickly outgrowing that solution as it has very little flexibility for the displaying of the data. It also doesn’t allow you to manipulate the data at all, and it would be nice to select specific date ranges. Still, pretty happy about my v1. And the management team was pretty excited as well. And asking for more.</p>

<p>This week I started reading Passionate Programmer by Chad Fowler. Moving from marketing to programming has been a big career change for me. I probably established certain work habits over the last 12 years or so and I feel like this is a good time to “empty my cup” and get some good advice on what it takes to be a good developer, besides knowing how to program.</p>

<p>It’s been very good so far. I particularly like the early parts on the place of a developer within a company, how he/she needs to contribute to the business and that should be his number one priority.</p>

<p>Next week we’re finalizing our apprenticeship list and I’m going to be pairing a lot more.</p>
